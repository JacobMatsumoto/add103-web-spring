    <h1>What is it?</h1>
    <p>Valentine's Day is on February 14th and its origins are sort of foggy. Some believe we celebrate it because of Saint Valentine. Valentine defied the Emperor at the time, Emperor Claudius II, who wanted to keep young people unwed to have more suitable soldiers. Valentine would wed young couples in secret but was caught and imprisoned and later killed. It's said that before his death he left a letter and signed it "Your Valentine" and sent it to a girl he had fallen for while imprisoned.</p>

    <h2>Why do we celebrate it?</h2>
    <p>We celebrate Valentine's Day for a multitude of reasons. Some spend it with their partner and buy chocolates, flowers, or plush toys and go out for a nice dinner. Some spend it with their loved ones, not just their partner. Some wait until the next day for cheap chocolates. Overall, it's a small "Hallmark Holiday," and everyone celebrates differently.  </p>
