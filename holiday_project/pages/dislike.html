    <h1>Why do Some People Dislike it?</h1>
    <p>Like with many things, there will always be people who dislikes something. Some people do just see Valentine's Day as nothing more than a shameless cash grab from big chocolate corperations and card companies to make some extra bucks off of "suckers"</p>

    <h2>The Pressure!</h2>
    <p>Some people dislike it because of the pressure socially of needing to make a big romantic gesture for their significant other. This pressure can add some stress and end up souring people to the Holiday. It can also put a pressure or even sadness on those who don't have a significant other, thus making them bitter towards the Holiday.
