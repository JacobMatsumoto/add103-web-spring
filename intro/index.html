    <h2>Walking</h2>
    <p>I go on walks with my s.o. and we talk and enjoy the walk (weather permiting)</p>
    <h2>Music</h2>
    <h3>Imagine Dragons</h3>
    <p>I always enjoyed their radio hits but after a rough patch in life I started listening to
    them more and more and I grew to love the majority of their music my favorite album being
    Smoke and Mirrors which just at the date of writing this (1/27/2025) had a
    10th anniversary album announced for it!</p>
    
    <h3>Epic the Musical</h3>
    <p>I found this by complete accident one day and it has consumed my music playlists. It is
    a collection of concept albums that make up a the artist's version of the Odyssey.</p> 
    
    <h3>Coldplay</h3>
    <p>I liked listening to their music when I was younger and it sort of carried over to
    adult-hood</p> 

    <h2>McHenry County College</h2>
    <p>I have been a student at <a href="https://www.mchenry.edu/">McHenry County College</a> 
        for 2 semesters. I am taking this class to pursue the 
        Software Application Design and Development AAS. I want to expand my skills and knowledge as 
        much as I can to build a better future for myself.
