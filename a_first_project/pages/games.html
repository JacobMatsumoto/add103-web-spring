            <h2>Gaming</h2>
            <p>I love playing video games, some of my favorite genres are RPGs and roguelikes. I play on just about any console and pc.
            My current obsessions have been playing through Avowed which is a very fun RPG. I have been having such a blast playing
            it, the story, gameplay and world building have been top notch in my opinion. I have also been playing Borderlands with
            my significant other. We have actually beaten the first and second games and now have started the third. Borderlands is
            a “looter shooter” basically meaning it's a first person shooter with a lot of looting elements in it. I unfortunately
            haven’t had nearly as much time to play games in recent years because work, school and life all sort of get in the way
            one way or another but, I still am very glad I get to unwind and relax with games here and there still. </p>

            <p>I have always loved to cook, I’d even go so far as to say I’m pretty good at it. I don’t cook anything fancy, but I can
            whip something up on the fly, and nine times out of ten, it’s pretty damn good. The other one time out of ten? Typically
            never gets made again.
            Back in high school, I took a couple of culinary classes and even earned my manager’s certification for working in a
            kitchen. Since then, I’ve spent about four or five years in the industry. While I don’t see a career in it anymore, I’m still grateful to do it for a living. It really is a passion of mine.
            One of my favorite things to cook is pasta. It’s a very involved process, and my significant other and I have been
            perfecting a recipe for quite a while now. Last time we made it, it was incredible
