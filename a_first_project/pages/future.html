            <h2>Future Endeavors</h2>
            <p>Coding is a new path in my life. I loved coding in Python. Every coding project is like a puzzle and I love trying to
            solve it. Learning to code has been incredibly fun even the parts that get hard to understand. My teachers teach in a
            very robust manner and that makes it feel so much better to learn. I’m also learning Swift and that has been a great
            challenge. The languages have their similarities but also a lot of very distinct differences in syntax. I’m also
            currently learning html which is what this writing and web page are for! I am liking Html although it seems to be more
            of a creative project rather than puzzle solving. This isn’t necessarily bad, I still enjoy the creative process as I
            don’t typically exercise that side of myself so this is a nice change of pace.
            Overall coding was a very pleasant surprise and I can’t wait to see where it takes me.
