    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>Iâ€™m 24 years old and to the left there is my cat. His name is Jay-Jay. I have lived in Crystal lake
    all my life and have recently decided to attend college at MCC. I Initially started in the cyber security program
    offered but after taking a class in Python programming I felt like I knew what I wanted to do for a living. And so, I
    pivoted into taking the Software Application Design and Development AAS still at MCC. I initially thought I wanted to be
    a cook but it happens to be a better hobby than career. I still cook a lot in my time off school and work. I enjoy going
    for walks and playing video games with my significant other. Some of our current favorites have been Minecraft,
    Borderlands, and Terraria. I live a relatively uneventful, quiet life. I live with my family and I like helping my
    little brothers with their homework.
