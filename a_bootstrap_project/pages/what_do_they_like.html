                        Rav is a very petite cat, she likes to hide but will come out and play when no one is around late at night. She was found on a Rav 4 truck, hence the name. Her and Taco are very similar.

                        Mira is my dads cat, she is incredibly old at about 17 or 18, she was an outdoor cat so we don't know how old exactly. She likes to sleep most of the day these days, with her age she is still very healthy and she really does love my dad, she will almost exclusively hang out around him or the highest spot in the house on the shelves in the kitchen.

                       Thor is my dads other cat, he is the definition of a trouble maker! He likes harrassing the other cats in the house to get them to play with him. He just likes to play and fight.
