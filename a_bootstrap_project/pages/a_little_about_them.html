                        Butts and Taco are best friends! ...when they chose to be... Butts is a very hyper active little guy, he has feline pica and will eat anything! Taco is very reserved but once he gets to like you he loves pets.

                        Martini! Martini is a baby cat we fostered for a few months, we found her outside at about 1-2 weeks old and helped nurture her back to health, she is a fighter! She fought so many illnesses and we're so glad we helped her get her forever home!
